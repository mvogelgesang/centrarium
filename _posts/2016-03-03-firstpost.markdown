I'm Mark, my friends call me Vogy and this is my blog. Here I will be ranting and raving about the world of agile software development and project management. These days I focus on Salesforce but previous work includes Drupal and the dying Coldfusion platform. While most posts will be about the world of web development I will also cover other topics that I find interesting such as cycling, ice cream, and beer.

The site is built on Jekyll and utilizes the [Centrarium](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium) theme developed by Ben Centra. I'll undoubtedly be making updates to the theme and writing about it here. You can follow the updates on [Github](https://github.com/mvogelgesang/vogysays).
